    </div>

    <p>In the scientific and industrial realms, extruded aluminum “profiles” have made a name as a highly flexible and useful building material. Its unique geometry simultaneously allows for immense strength and great utility. Profiles can serve as structural material, machine guarding, architectural or artistic pieces, and as a platform for mounting devices and fixtures. In my experiences, one can find daily use for such material, both at home and at work.</p>

<p>After seeing the usefulness of extruded profiles first-hand, I thought up a way to use aluminum extrusion to fill a recent need for custom furniture here on the homefront. Up until recently, my wife and I were looking at “coffee nook” cabinets and furniture to serve as a home for our coffee beans, grinder, presses, ceramics, and other related prep ware. Pinterest and Instagram offered many ideas for a home-made coffee bar design, but none used extruded aluminum as a base, so I opted to design the piece in the image below.</p>

<p>I designed a table which used 25mm profiles, sourced from <strong><a href="https://8020.net/">80/20 Inc.</a></strong>, that were anodized with a black finish at the factory. In my opinion, the black finish provides better decorative value than other profiles, which normally come with a clear finish, leaving the natural silver color of aluminum exposed. The dimensions of the frame itself, 40″W x 34″H x 18″D, allowed for a standard, birch, ‘butcher block’ tabletop to be mounted on the top of the stand after trimming two of the edges down. In lieu of a stain or urethane coating, the butcher block was treated with a beeswax-infused mineral oil to provide food-safe protection. Two shelves, also made from birch, were trimmed and mounted on the inside of the frame, supported by black aluminum gussets. These shelves allow for significant storage space for ceramics and glassware inside the frame. Leveling feet from <strong><a href="https://www.mcmaster.com/">McMaster-Carr</a></strong> are installed in tapped holes on the bottom of the extrusion, which could be later replaced by casters.</p>

<p>The unique structure of aluminum extrusion allows the designer to brace cross-members with gussets, tap the ends to screw other fixtures into place, or bore through the center to secure and suspend materials at a perpendicular angle to the aluminum profile. The downsides to using extrusion, or any other metal framing material, really come from the cost, and the difficulty in which is presented when trying to cut bars to length or bore through the frame. If you have a drill and a saw capable of piercing aluminum, then I highly recommend using extruded aluminum profiles for your next project.</p>

<p>Specially anodized extrusion commands a higher overall price than using plumbing pipes or other faux-industrial materials, as is common in DIY furniture at the moment, but the ability to radically reconfigure the structure of the coffee bar without any material loss is well worth the higher price. The channeled face allows for attachments to be mounted to the frame without power tools, and special plastic “<em>channel-fill</em>” can be added to smooth out the look and feel of the frame.  Overall, the coffee bar looks quite nice in our home and the design is flexible, simple, and sleek. The wife is also pretty happy with it, so I plan on utilizing extrusion-based designs, or making further modifications to this one, in future furniture projects!</p>
