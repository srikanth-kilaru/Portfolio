                <title>Got the Job!</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;After sending over 50+ job applications, I finally got a job at a healthcare software company! The company, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.interfaceware.com/&quot;&gt;iNTERFACEWARE&lt;/a&gt; specializes in making a healthcare integration engine called Iguana, which they use to solve healthcare system integration problems for healthcare organizations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, I got the job not by sending in my resume for screening, but by contacting the CEO of the company directly (I had met him a year earlier at a career event at my school), and asking to meet up for a quick coffee at their offices. He agreed, and the quick coffee turned into my first interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A month later, I got the job.&lt;/p&gt;
