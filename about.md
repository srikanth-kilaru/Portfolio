Hello, I am a graduate student at Northwestern University in the MS Robotics program and I expect to graduate at the end of summer 2018.
I consider myself very fortunate to have the opportunity to immerse myself in all things robotics at a time in human history where robots are at the cusp of entering everyday life.
I firmly believe that in the very near future, robots will play an ubiquitous role in most households of the developed world, and I am very interested in solving the technology challenges that are hindering the successful adoption of robots as assistants at home. Prior to re-entering student life, I was in a well-established career track as a senior director of product line management in the San Francisco Bay Area.

I have a Bachelor of Science in Geophysics from Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kharagpur, and a Master of Science in Computer Science at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI). I also obtained an MBA from Santa Clara University while working as a senior engineer at Cisco systems.

In my previous industry career, I worked in the data center and cloud technology space. In this domain,I have directly worked with data networks (Ethernet switching, IPv4, IPv6, and MPLS, QoS), Software Defined Networking (SDN), Server virtualization, Network Function Virtualization (NFV), and network security.

I have lead product management and engineering teams, developed key technology alliances, and made significant individual contributions enabling the products I worked on to garner first or second position in market share. My 20 year career has spanned working at startups (ConSentry), mid-sized companies (Palo Alto Networks, Juniper) and large companies (Cisco, HP). At Juniper and HP,  I was one of the first employees to start brand-new product lines, and at my most recent employer, Palo Alto Networks, I lead the company's efforts to grow the Service provider market.
I also advise a couple of startup companies in the SF Bay area and provide consultation services to financial investors and analysts covering the networking, cloud, and security industry.

Some of the products I have managed and/or contributed significantly to develop are -
